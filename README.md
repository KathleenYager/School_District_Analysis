# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
Receiving evidence that the ninth graders at Thomas High School (THS) were dishonest when completing their math and reading testing, scores were rerun to exclude this group from the district data. The following report provides an analysis without the ninth graders at THS included. 

###Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to provide analysis of the district using the amended dataset that excludes the ninth grade class at Thomas High School. The analysis offers average scores for math and reading, per capita cost , school size by school and type of school in the district. 

###Results
The results of the analysis indicate that the overall percentages, meaning a combined score for reading and math range between 80-97%. Charter school are more likely to have fewer students enrolled. Per capita spending for students ranges between $571-655. 

    - School Type: Two types of schools are identified in the district: District schools and Charter schools. Charter schools tend to have smaller student populations than their district counterparts. 
    - Total Students: The population size of the school seems to produce higher average testing scores for both math and reading. 
    - Total Budget: Overall budget size range from under $1 million to over $3 million. Charter schools typically have smaller budgets with high math and reading testing averages. 
    - Per Student Budget: The per capita spending for students is most often lower in charter schools and the students at the school score on average in the 90% range for math and reading. 
    - Average Math Score: The average math score for all fifteen schools ranges 76-83% across the district. 
    - Average Reading Score: The average reading score for all fifteen schools range 80-83%. 
    - % of Students Passing Math: About 93% of students in the district pass math. 
    - % of Students Passing Reading: About 97% of students in the district pass reading. 
    - Overall percent of Students Passing both Math and Reading: About 97% of students pass both math and reading throughout the district. 

## Summary
Spending per school and school type seems to have little impact on the results. The data suggests that the higher the number of students at the school, the per capita spending increases and often average scores by school are lower than schools with smaller populations. This would suggest that smaller class size may impact average scores on both reading and math.
